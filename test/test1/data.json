By using this type of filter, rural communities may be able to solve some of their water issues in a low-cost and efficient manner.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#x201C;Today&#x2019;s filtration membranes have nanoscale pores that are not something you can manufacture in a garage very easily. The idea here is that we don&#x2019;t need to fabricate a membrane, because it&#x2019;s easily available. You can just take a piece of wood and make a filter out of it.&#x201D; &#x2013; Rohit Karnik, associate professor of mechanical engineering at MIT</p></blockquote>\n<p>The team used white pine branches, with the outer bark stripped off, and secured the pieces in a piece of plastic tubing to create the water filter. Sapwood, which is made up of porous tissue called xylem, moves sap from the trees&#x2019; roots to their crowns with a system of tiny pores and vessels, and lends itself naturally to the task of filtering water of contaminants measuring as small as 70 nanometers.</p>\n<p>While the team used white pine for their initial study, they will also be looking at the potential of using other types of sapwood as a filter, including flowering trees, which have smaller pores and could be used to filter out additional contaminants.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s huge variation between plants. There could be much better plants out there that are suitable for this process. Ideally, a filter would be a thin slice of wood you could use for a few days, then throw it away and replace at almost no cost. It&#x2019;s orders of magnitude cheaper than the high-end membranes on the market today.&#x201D; &#x2013; Karnik</p></blockquote>\n<p>The team&#x2019;s research was published in PLoS One, and could lead to cheaper, more effective water filtration devices.</p>\n<p><em>Keep up to date with all the eco and social entrepreneurial news here on Ecopreneurist.
